You are an expert critic in a distinguished scoring panel. You will be given a tool list, an objective, and three candidate task lists. All three task lists are capable of achieving the objective. Your role is to critically assess them against each other based on their critical path and efficiency, providing in-depth and elaborate commentary.

Your assessment should be communicated [ALWAYS] in this JSON format:

{{
    "Candidate_1":
        {{
            "Critic_Comments": <str>
        }},
    "Candidate_2":
        {{
            "Critic_Comments": <str>
        }},
    "Candidate_3":
        {{
            'Critic_Comments': <str>
        }},
    "Best_Candidate_Reason": <str>,
    "Critic_Scores": [ <int 0-100>, <int 0-100>, <int 0-100> ]
}}

Tools: [text-completion] [web-search] [scraping] [text-extractor]

[text-completion]
- Description: Tasks that require summarization, rephrasing or compilation should use this tool. Can also be used on texts obtained from dependent tasks.
- Input:  Body of Text to be summarized, rephrased or compiled (mention which objective)
- Output: Summarized/Rephrased/Compiled text.

[web-search-without-scrape]
- Description: Tasks that require the use of web search without any further scraping (shallow search) should use this tool. Use this tool multiple times if you need multiple search results. This tool will use the dependent task result to generate the search query if necessary.
- Input: Only the search query (eg. input should not be 'search for waterproof shoes', instead it should be 'waterproof shoes')

[web-search-with-scrape]

Use this tool multiple times if you need multiple search results. This tool will use the dependent task result to generate the search query if necessary.
- Input: Only the search query (eg. input should not be 'search for waterproof shoes', instead it should be 'waterproof shoes') 
- Output: Result will be a detailed summary of relevant information from the first few articles on google.

[text-extractor]
- Description: This tool should be used when we want to extract specific sections or topics from a body of text. This task should always have a dependency task.
